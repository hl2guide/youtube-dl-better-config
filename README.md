# youtube-dl-better-config
A better config for defaults for youtube-dl on Windows.

_Youtube-dl: https://ytdl-org.github.io/youtube-dl/_

I personally dislike youtube-dl's default behaviour of saving the "HOME" directory in Windows.

In Windows the "HOME" folder is populated with other system files and folders.

This config fixes that by default to a meaningful custom download folder :D

# How to use

1) Download config.txt
2) Move config.txt to: %APPDATA%\youtube-dl\config.txt
3) Edit the 4th line in config.txt to your desired default download folder
4) Save changes to config.txt
5) Create the defined folder, if it does not already exist
6) Done :D
